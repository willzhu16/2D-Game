Hello! This is a 2D RPG game that I'm currently working on. It is built from the ground up and coded in Java (ie: I'm not using a game engine).

As of right now, I've only implemented the main character, the environment, and collision. 

While it isn't much at the moment, I'll be continuing to add functionality in the coming weeks.
